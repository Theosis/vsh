The files 1-8 are the intermediate fact-bases generated by running each phase 
of the compiler manually.  They were generated early in the project and might
be stale, but give an idea of how the fact-base grows as more semantic
information is added.  Of course, one could re-create these files using
the latest code by running each component manually.
